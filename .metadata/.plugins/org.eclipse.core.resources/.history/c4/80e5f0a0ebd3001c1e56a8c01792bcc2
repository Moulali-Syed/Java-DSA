/*
 * everything starts with capital letter is class - String is a class name is
 * reference variable "Apple Shimla" is object
 * 
 * String a = "hi"; String b="hi";
 * 
 * String pool: in above a will created in stack and points to heap memory in
 * which we have string pool when b is created in stack it will check if there
 * exists a value assigned to it in string pool if exists it points to it , else
 * creates new
 * 
 * Thus optimised code

 * Immutability:
