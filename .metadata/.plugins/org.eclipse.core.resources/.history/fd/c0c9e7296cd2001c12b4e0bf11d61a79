//public means can be accessed from anywhere
//in java it is convention that we must have a main function

//class - group of methods

//main is method name - it is reserved java always looks for it , it is entry point for java program
//so we make it public
//main method is part of the Demo01 class
//it shouldnot depend on object so we made it static
//args[0] can be passed at run time - java Demo01.java 30


//if file name is Demo01 then class Name must be Demo01


//convert java code to byte code

// in cmd write cd C:\Testing\Java-DSA\JavaCoding\src\theory\
//then javac FileName.java
//now we can go to the path C:\Testing\Java-DSA\JavaCoding\src\theory\ and see we will get fileName.class file generated
//thus its converted to byte code
//now we can run
//java Demo01.java
