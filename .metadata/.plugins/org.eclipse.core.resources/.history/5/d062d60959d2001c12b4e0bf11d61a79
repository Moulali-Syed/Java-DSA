Types of languages:

		1.Procedural 
		2.Functional
		3.Object Oriented
		
	Procedural Programming:
	specifies a series of well structured steps and procedures to compose a program
	Contains a systematic order of statements , functions and commands to complete a task
	
	Functional Programming:
	writing a program only in pure functions i.e never modify variables , but only create new ones as an output
	used in situations where we have to perform lots of different operations on same set of data , like ML
	first class functions?
	functions are block of code which is reusable , if we are able to reassign the function variables or 
	references to other variables then it is first class
	
	Object Oriented Programming
	Revolves around objects
	code+data = objects
	developed to make it easier to develop ,debug, reuse and maintain software
	class - named group of data and functions
	
	
	Static vs Dynamic Languages:
	
	Static
	Perform type checking at compile time
	errors will show at compile time
	declare datatype before you use it
	more control
	
	Dynamic:
	Perform type checking at runtime
	error might not show till program is run
	no need to declare datatype of variables
	saves time in writing code but might give error at run time
