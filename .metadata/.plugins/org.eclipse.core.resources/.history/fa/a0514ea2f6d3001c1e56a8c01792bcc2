Class : is a named group of properties and functions

If u want to create ur own datatype u can do it by creating a class

For suppose we need to store data of students like rollnumber, name , marks 
we can either store it in array seperately , if we need all data combinely 
we can create our own datatype using classes
Student[] students = new Student[5];
