Class : is a named group of properties and functions

If u want to create ur own datatype u can do it by creating a class

For suppose we need to store data of students like rollnumber, name , marks 
we can either store it in array seperately , if we need all data combinely 
we can create our own datatype using classes
Student[] students = new Student[5];

class is a blue print

A car can be class - same template we can have different cars from many companies
seats , engine , price - maruti|ferrari|Audi

all these cars have same property engine but have different values

maruti - 4 seats, diesel engine , 1lakh
Ferarri -  7 seats, petrol engine , 1crore
AUdi -   4 seats, diesel engine , 50lakhs

do car exist physically , no the objects made from the blueprint like maruti ,ferrari, audi exists with different
values but same properties
