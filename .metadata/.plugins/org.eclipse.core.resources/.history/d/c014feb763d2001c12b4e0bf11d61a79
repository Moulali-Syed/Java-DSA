How java code executes

.java file 		-----compiler----->	 .classfile   ------interpreter--------> machineCode
(human readble)		(entire file)	  (byte code)		line by line		  (0 and 1)

source code
this code will not directly run on a system
we need JVM to run this
reason why java is platform independent

platform independence

it means byte code can run on any Operating system
