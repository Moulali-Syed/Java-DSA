Class : is a named group of properties and functions

If u want to create ur own datatype u can do it by creating a class

For suppose we need to store data of students like rollnumber, name , marks 
we can either store it in array seperately , if we need all data combinely 
we can create our own datatype using classes
Student[] students = new Student[5];

class is a blue print

A car can be class - same template we can have different cars from many companies
seats , engine , price - maruti|ferrari|Audi

all these cars have same property engine but have different values

maruti - 4 seats, diesel engine , 1lakh
Ferarri -  7 seats, petrol engine , 1crore
AUdi -   4 seats, diesel engine , 50lakhs

do car exist physically , no the objects made from the blueprint like maruti ,ferrari, audi exists with different
values but same properties

A class is a template , Object is an instance of class i.e creating a physical thing

class - logical construct
object - physical reality // occupies space in memory

Object - has 3 things

State   - value from datatype
Identity  - like where value is stored in memory
Behaviour  - the affect of datatype operations

variables inside object is instance variable

//access instance variables use the dot operator
Student obj = new Student();
obj.rollNum;

//creating object -
use the new keyword
class Student{
	int rno;
	String name;
	float marks;
	
}

Student std = new Student();

new - dynamically allocates memory and returns reference to it

Student std1 = new Student();
compile time   run time

default values:
rno=0
name = null
marks = 0.0

this keyword
overriding constructor using this keyword

package oop;

public class StudentC {

	int rno;
	String name;
	float marks;
	// we need a way to add values of above properties object by object
	// we need one word to access every object - this keyword helps
	// constructor

	StudentC() {

		// calling constructor from another constructor
//		we use this keyword - this(12,"apple",12.02f)
		this(11,"hey",12.01f);
		
		
		this.rno = 13;
		this.name = "Apple";
		this.marks = 1.2f;

	}

	StudentC(int roll, String name, float marks) {
		this.rno = roll;
		this.name = name;
		this.marks = marks;
	}

	void changeName(String name) {
		this.name = name;
	}

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		StudentC stud = new StudentC();
		System.out.println(stud.rno);
		System.out.println(stud.name = "Shimla");

		StudentC stud1 = new StudentC(12, "hi", 12.4f);
		stud1.changeName("hello");

	}
}
